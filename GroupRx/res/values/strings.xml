        <item>Yes, just use the share options located in the side menu to send the app to anyone. The side

        <item>Yes anyone may use the program if it is used at pharmacies within the U.S. and it s territories.</item>
        <item>            No. This program will not affect the way you are cared for by your physician. You should,
			however, always consult with your doctor about saving money on prescription medications.</item>
        <item>            Industry standards determine the discounted rate for prescription medications. This means in 
			most instances, all participating pharmacies will offer the same low price. These rates are 
			updated at least once a week, so prices may vary depending on when you go to the pharmacy. 
			From time-to-time, pharmacies may offer special sale prices for a limited time on selected 
			drugs. These sale prices may be lower than the scheduled discount rates, in which case the 
			card holder will pay only the lowered sales price. We always encourage comparison shopping.</item>
        <item>            All chain pharmacies and most independent pharmacies have been given equal opportunity to 
			serve you via this program. Pharmacies are required to offer very deep discounts and assist in 
			performing some fairly complicated drug management procedures on behalf of our card holders, 
			and some pharmacies simply refuse. However that gives you the confidence of knowing that 
			pharmacies participating have your best interests in mind and that there are the majority of 
			pharmacies in your regional area accept your card.</item>
        <item>As a member, you are entitled to your benefit. Your pharmacist will not know what the card
			savings will be until the prescription is sent for pricing through the pharmacist s computer. If your 
			Pharmacist does not want to comply with the program, you should consider going to another 
			nearby pharmacy that honors the card.</item>
        <item>			    This program can be used to obtain savings on prescription drugs that are excluded by your
				insurance plan or are not covered because you have exceeded your insurance plan s maximum 
				limits. In some instances, you might find that the Card s price is lower than your program s co-
				payment amount, but not usually. In addition, if your plan does not offer you a drug card and you 
				are reimbursed after each transaction, you may be able to use the Card to lower your out-of-
				pocket expenses.</item>

    <string name="pet_card_info">The Free Pet Drug Card allows you to save money on most pet medications with just a click.
         		Since about 95 of the medication that we give to pets is only a different dosage of the medicine we take ourselves,
         		rather than spending more buying marked-up drugs from your Vet, you can give your furry friend the medicine they need at the pharmacy price.
         		All you need is a Free Pet Drug Card and a written prescription from your Vet to save up to 85% on drugs for your dog, cat or other pet. \n \n
				When you go to the vet and pay for medicine, you are overpaying on wholesale markups simply to get a different dosage of medicine
				available at any participating pharmacy. The Free Pet Drug Card allows you to get the right drug for your pet and save up to 85. \n \n
				To take advantage of our Free Pet Drug Card, all you need to do is present this card to your pharmacist. There is no expiration date,
				no limit to usages and no paperwork to fill out. The card is accepted in 63,000 pharmacies across the nation to get you the best deal on prescriptions.</string>
